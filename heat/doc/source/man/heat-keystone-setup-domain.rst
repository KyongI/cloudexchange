.. program:: heat-keystone-setup-domain


SYNOPSIS
========

``heat-keystone-setup-domain [OPTIONS]``


DESCRIPTION
===========

The `heat-keystone-setup-domain` tool configures keystone by creating
a 'stack user domain' and the user credential used to manage this domain.
A 'stack user domain' can be treated as a namespace for projects,
groups and users created by heat.  The domain will have an admin user
that manages other users, groups and projects in the domain.

This script requires admin keystone credentials to be available in the
shell environment by setting `OS_USERNAME` and `OS_PASSWORD`.

After running this script, a user needs to take actions to check or
modify the heat configuration file (e.g. /etc/heat/heat.conf).  The tool
is NOT performing these updates on behalf of the user.

Distributions may provide other tools to setup 'stack user domain' for
use with heat, so check the distro documentation first.  Other tools
are available to set up the 'stack user domain', for example
`python-openstackclient`, which is preferred to this tool where it is
available.


OPTIONS
=======

.. cmdoption:: -h, --help

  Print usage information.

.. cmdoption:: --config-dir <DIR>

  Path to a config directory from which to read the ``heat.conf`` file(s).
  This file set is sorted, so as to provide a predictable parse order
  if individual options are over-ridden. The set is parsed after the
  file(s) specified via previous --config-file, arguments hence over-ridden
  options in the directory take precedence.

.. cmdoption:: --config-file <PATH>

  Path to a config file to use. Multiple config files can be specified,
  with values in later files taking precedence. The default files used
  is `/etc/heat/heat.conf`.

.. cmdoption:: --stack-domain-admin <USERNAME>

  Name of a user for Keystone to create, which has roles sufficient to
  manage users (i.e. stack domain users) and projects (i.e. stack domain
  projects) in the 'stack user domain'.

  Another way to specify the admin user name is by setting an environment
  variable `STACK_DOMAIN_ADMIN` before running this tool.  If both command
  line arguments and environment variable are specified, the command line
  arguments take precedence.

.. cmdoption:: --stack-domain-admin-password <PASSWORD>

  Password for the 'stack-domain-admin' user.

  The password can be instead specified using an environment variable
  `STACK_DOMAIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` before invoking this tool.  If both command
  line arguments and environment variable are specified, the command line
  arguments take precedence.

.. cmdoption:: --stack-user-domain-name <DOMAIN>

  Name of domain to create for stack users.

  The domain name can be instead specified using an environment variable
  `STACK_USER_DOMAIN_NAME` before invoking this tool.  If both command line
  arguments and environment variable are specified, the command line argument
  take precedence.

.. cmdoption:: --version

  Show program's version number and exit. The output could be empty if
  the distribution didn't specify any version information.

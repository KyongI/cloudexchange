Contributed Heat Resource Types
===============================

Rackspace Cloud Resource Types
------------------------------

.. rubric:: These resources are not enabled by default.

The resources in this module are for using Heat with the Rackspace
Cloud. These resources either allow using Rackspace services that don't
have equivalent services in OpenStack or account for differences between
a generic OpenStack deployment and the Rackspace Cloud.

Rackspace resources depend on the dev branch of
`pyrax <https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/tree/dev>`_ to work
properly. More information about them can be found in the
`RACKSPACE_README
<https://github.com/openstack/heat/blob/master/contrib/rackspace/README.md>`_.

DockerInc Resource
------------------

.. rubric:: This resource is not enabled by default.

This plugin enables the use of  Docker containers in a Heat template and
requires the `docker-py <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-py>`_
package. You can find more information in the `DOCKER_README
<https://github.com/openstack/heat/blob/master/contrib/heat_docker/README.md>`_.

Building JEOS images for use with Heat
======================================
Heat's full functionality can only be used when launching cloud images that have
the heat-cfntools_ package installed.
This document describes some options for creating a heat-cfntools enabled image
for yourself.

.. _heat-cfntools: https://github.com/openstack/heat-cfntools

Building an image with diskimage-builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
diskimage-builder_ is a tool for customizing cloud images.
tripleo-image-elements_ is a collection of diskimage-builder elements related
to the TripleO_ project. It includes an element for heat-cfntools which can be
used to create heat-enabled images.

.. _diskimage-builder: https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder
.. _tripleo-image-elements: https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-image-elements
.. _TripleO: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO

Install the tool (preferably in a virtualenv) and fetch the elements::

    pip install git+https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder.git
    git clone https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-image-elements.git

To create a heat-cfntools enabled image with the current release of Fedora x86_64::

    export ELEMENTS_PATH=tripleo-image-elements/elements
    disk-image-create vm fedora heat-cfntools -a amd64 -o fedora-heat-cfntools

The image may then be pushed to glance, e.g::

    source ~/.openstack/keystonerc
    glance image-create --name fedora-heat-cfntools --is-public true --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare < fedora-heat-cfntools.qcow2

To create a heat-cfntools enabled image with the current release of Ubuntu i386::

    export ELEMENTS_PATH=tripleo-image-elements/elements
    disk-image-create vm ubuntu heat-cfntools -a i386 -o ubuntu-heat-cfntools

If you are creating your own images you should consider creating golden images
which contain all the packages required for the stacks that you launch. You can do
this by writing your own diskimage-builder elements and invoking those elements
in the call to disk-image-create.

This means that the resulting heat templates only need to modify configuration
files. This will speed stack launch time and reduce the risk of a transient
package download failure causing the stack launch to fail.

To create an image that contains hooks needed for SoftwareConfig and SoftwareDeployment,
you can follow the steps bellow to build a fedora based image::

    pip install git+https://git.openstack.org/openstack/diskimage-builder.git
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/tripleo-image-elements.git
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/heat-templates.git
    export ELEMENTS_PATH=tripleo-image-elements/elements:heat-templates/hot/software-config/elements
    disk-image-create vm \
        fedora selinux-permissive \
        heat-config \
        os-collect-config \
        os-refresh-config \
        os-apply-config \
        heat-config-cfn-init \
        heat-config-puppet \
        heat-config-script \
        -o fedora-software-config.qcow2

The image may then be pushed to glance, e.g::

    source ~/.openstack/keystonerc
    glance image-create --name=fedora-software-config --is-public=true --disk-format=qcow2 --container-format=bare < fedora-software-config.qcow2

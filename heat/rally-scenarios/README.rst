This directory contains rally benchmark scenarios to be run by OpenStack CI.

Structure:
* heat.yaml is rally task that will be run in gates
* plugins - directory where you can add rally plugins. So you don't need
  to merge benchmark in scenarios in rally to be able to run them in heat.
* extra - all files from this directory will be copied to gates, so you will
  be able to use absolute path in rally tasks. Files will be in ~/.rally/extra/*

##### Virtual-Tenant-Network-Orchestrator

##### Rationale
In era of cloud computing, tenants have more and more data interactions with datacenter network, and also secure connections, QoS and elastic adjustment are needed. Consequently, MPLS tunnel is a better solution to construct VPN through backbone.

Esp. in designing high availability architectures using multi-regions we need to address the following set of challenges:

- Workload Migration - ability to migrate our application environment across regions
- Data Synch - ability to migrate real time copy of the data between the two or more regions
- Network Flow - ability to enable flow of network traffic between two or more regions

##### Goal and Objectives
For userâ€™s perspective, the goals of the proposal are.
- Get data close to global applications
- Avoid latency cost of commit between sites
- Keep running during intermittent network failures between sites
- Keep running if a site fails
- Enable simple recovery when it comes back

To implement these features, we are going to enhance VTN Neutron bundle or to provide Heat Resource Plug-in.

##### VTN Neutron Enhancement
OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN)
=========================================

## ODL VTN overview

OpenDaylight VTN provides multi-tenant virtual network functions on
OpenDaylight controller. OpenDaylight VTN consists of two parts:
VTN Coordinator and VTN Manager.

VTN Coordinator orchestrates multiple OpenDaylight Controllers, and provides
applications with VTN API.

VTN Manager is a set of OSGi bundles running in OpenDaylight Controller.
Current VTN Manager supports only OpenFlow switches. It handles PACKET_IN
messages, sends PACKET_OUT messages, manages host information, and installs
flow entries into OpenFlow switches to provide VTN Coordinator with virtual
network functions.

The requirements for installing these two are different. Therefore, we
recommend that you install VTN Manager and VTN Coordinator in different
machines.

VTN Neutron bundle will be enhanced in the VTN Manager to operate with HEAT Manager. It supports to create the virtual tenant network between multiple clouds and cooperate with Heat Manager to deploy VMs on this virtual network.

##### Heat Resource Plug-in
Heat is a service to orchestrate multiple composite cloud applications using templates, through both an OpenStack-native REST API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API. Heat allows service providers to extend the capabilities of the orchestration service by writing their own resource plug-ins. We will provide the heat resource plug-in. The plug-in creates the virtual tenant network between multiple clouds and deploys VMs on this virtual network.
